## Markdown syntax checks

I (DerDanilo) decided against linter checks for now as it will stretch the time needed
to push content a lot and people rather tend not to commit their changes if it requires
to much time. We may add them later though.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions and fixes for this documentation.
